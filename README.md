# hello-world
This is for a class assignment

I wanna live in the city with no friends and family.
I'm gonna look out the window of my color TV.
I'm gonna remember to remember to forget you forgot me.
I'm watching TV of some guy saying something smart which was nothing at all;
so I guess that's a solution.
My cable bill will be a receipt that said "I didn't buy nothin'."
